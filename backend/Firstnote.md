First 
I want a button telling "Log in/Sign up" , in the right corner of the page
 If we click that button , It should take you to a page, where you can login.....
The login Page should ask for Name, Gender,age, Mail id and password....all these data of the user should be stored

And the user should be logged in through out, Until the user gives logout

once the user logs in
the "Log in or Sign Up" should Change into a circle , the circle should have a unique identity to the every user.... for example if user's name is Pooja Shree , circle should have "PS" , suppose if another user's name is "Pooja Sankar" then circle should have "PoS" or something like that....... It should not repeat
